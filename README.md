# Game of thrones Books App
A simple app to understand the working of fetch api and promises in javascript.

## Description
This app uses fetch api to get list of books from an external api.
I have used HTML, CSS3, and vanilla Javascript to create this app.


##To run it locally:
1. First clone the repo
2. Open the index.html file


The page will reload if you make edits, if you are using a live server\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
